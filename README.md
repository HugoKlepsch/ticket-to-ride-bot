# Ticket to Ride bot

⚠️This is a work in progress. Not working yet.

# High level design

There are two applications:
* The bot which will play "Ticket to Ride", [`bot.py`](./bot.py).
* The tool for configuration, [`configurator.py`](./configurator.py). This tool helps 
input game data like maps, cities and their routes, screen regions, available tickets etc.
